XXXX XXXX about a fraudulent debt that was placed on my credit report. Someone attempted to rent an apartment in my name and the fees associated with them submitting an application in my name have been attached to my credit file. I have contacted XXXX XXXX and told them directly the account they were reporting was fraud and they have been verbally abusive to me, and refused to remove the account from my credit file even though they know the collection is as a result of identity fraud. I have contacted XXXX XXXX in Experian 's Consumer Relations Department 7 times in total and left voice mail messages for him and he has never returned any of my very detailed messages. I was told by Experian to contact XXXX XXXX when I noticed information on my credit file that was fraudulent. I have done as I was asked to do, but in all of the 7 detailed messages I left for XXXX XXXX over the course of 2 weeks he has not responded to any of them and has not blocked the fraudulent collection account that XXXX has placed against my credit. I have provided XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX a copy of my very recent police report regarding the fraud that was committed against me and they both have refused to abide by the FCRA Section 605 B, and are defaming my character and intentionally inflicting emotional distress by reporting fraudulent information that they have both been told does not belong to me.

On the XXXX I made my second to witch they took two different amounts from my checking account. My wife and I have a XXXX XXXX old and a XXXX year old and we live paycheck to paycheck. Due to Mr. Cooper taking multiple amounts out of our account we were overdraft it took over a week and 6 calls to have the money reimbursed. By this time other bills and personal purchases were made that we had to make and another XXXX $ in overdrafts were charged to my checking. Mr. Cooper should be responsible for these. If the second amount they took was never taken then my bills and other purchases would of been without my bank fees. To top this on XX/XX/XXXX they proceeded to make multiple bogus deposits and corrections on my Mr. Cooper account.I have called daily after XX/XX/XXXX and beginning of XX/XX/XXXX to figure out what they are doing. Somehow through this mess of them taking multiple transactions and then finally reimbursing me for what shouldnt of been taken Im told Im late for XX/XX/XXXXsecond payment? Since then Ive tried to get explanation on some un-applied funds I have in my account that they can not give me an answer about. So maybe 30 days go by of trying to get a answer that nobody wants to answer and I get a foreclosure letter. Apparently Im 30 days late on XXXX $ and I get a foreclosure notice? Ive been trying to resolve this but to know help, if you email customer service you just get a default reply email from them that nobody ever follows up on, just get the beat around from customer service on the phone and every call last 35-40mins that takes away from my kids and work to get absolutely no answer period.m. Daily calls of I need to make a payment and now getting more aggressive in there tone of voice, e-mail payment remainders daily. So I figured I cant loose my home over this so I agree to pay the XXXX $ that Im apparently behind. I Make a payment agreement witch I never received any paperwork on yet, to spread the XXXX $ over 3 months on top of my normal monthly mortgage payment. OK! Whatever it takes to keep my home. Still receiving calls on how I need to make a payment and emails. Yesterday XX/XX/XXXX I received a call stating I have 14days until the For-closure process starts, I said how are you starting the process if I have an agreement for the payments and very rudely the lady said its just what I have to tell you. I have until XX/XX/XXXX to make my first installment payment and Im getting calls about foreclosure starting in 14days? 60 days have passed since beginning of XXXX and already a foreclosure process? I have been 100 % positively working to resolve this matter and even agree to pay the XXXX .
