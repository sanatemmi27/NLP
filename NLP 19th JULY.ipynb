I now owe a total of {$160000.00}. Some money is being paid through Chapter XXXX but it only goes to interest and is not enough so the interest keeps accumulating. I would like to refinance the loan at a lower rate but ca n't because Congress has to change the rules. I am almost XXXX years old. This loan will never be paid off. Is there a way to stop the accumulated interest at such a high rate. Is there a way to forgive that extra interest? I feel trapped. This feels like a mafia shakedown. I ca n't even discharge this in bankruptcy. Even after Chapter XXXX payment will be way to high. If I apply for Social Security, they will garnish that. Please try to do something about this. Thanks.\",\n",
       " \"Our VA loan was sold to Loancare within 30 days of closing in XX/XX/XXXX . We have not had any issues until now. On  XX/XX/XXXX  ( date of statement, not the date the statement was received ) we received a letter stating our escrow was - {$5100.00} and starting XX/XX/XXXX , ONE MONTH NOTICE, our payments will increase {$710.00}! Wow, how can this be? Who can make such a drastic increase in payments? I started researching and seeking help through outside sources so I could learn more about what I was going up against. I submitted a request online from  Loancare  for my detailed escrow statement from the beginning of the loan. I received the same statement I had already received in the mail. I called on  XX/XX/XXXX   XXXX , spoke to  XXXX  #  XXXX , and he was unable to see what happened so put me on the phone with supervisor  XXXX   .   XXXX  stated that m y Homestead Exemption w as not applied to the loan.  XXXX  called  the county  while I was on hold and also verified online that my  Homestead Exempti  on  was active. She stated she would upload it to my loan and contact the tax supervisor at their company and within 5 days have the payments adjusted. I called on  XX/XX/XXXX , spoke to  XXXX  #  XXXX , and was told that nothing was pending and no task was opened 5 days ago. She stated that they have a copy of the  Homestead  paperwork but want me to get a copy of the  Homestead Exemption  showing it is active and send it to them. She stated I should of done this when I requested the escrow breakdown? How was I to know to do this if no one asked me to? I was told a stop would be put on any late fees that  may  accrue. I stated that they should already have that information because the supervisor I spoke with said she was able to pull it up. I asked to speak to a supervisor and was told they were all busy and she would have  one  call me back in an hour. I knew they would n't but was assured she would see to it that they do. I received no call and it was the weekend so they were closed and I could n't call back.  XX/XX/XXXX  I was able to hunt down the  Homestead Exemption  and emailed it to Loancare as requested. I called on  XX/XX/XXXX , spoke to  XXXX , and was told that the Homestead Exemption I sent has an estimated tax for the upcoming year and I need to submit the actual tax. WHAT? First off, I received that information fro m the county a nd they do n't have the tax yet, which is why it is estimated. And secondly, this is not what was requested of me, the  Homestead Exemption be ing active is what I was asked to show. And lastly, this is not my job, this is what I pay them to do. I asked to speak to her supervisor and was placed on the phone with  XXXX   XXXX . She stated she does n't know why anyone is telling me they need the  Homestead  paperwork as it is already applied to my loan. She stated the escrow is short because of an error on their behalf. Apparently  Loancare  paid the school taxes and no t the county t axes. They tried to blame it  on the county no t billing them. I remember getting tax statements  from the county so  I pulled those out and on XX/XX/XXXX I had called Loancare, spoke to  XXXX , stating that I received the school taxes and asked is they have a copy of it. He said they already have it but since it is for {$2300.00} and they show {$1400.00}, to fax it to him. I faxed it and have a confirmation sheet showing it was received. I was told by  XXXX  that I now have to pay f or the county  taxes and get my escrow current. The school taxes were {$2300.00} and  the county  taxes were {$2300.00}.  XXXX  stated my escrow had {$1500.00} balance before they paid the school  and county  taxes. I told her this is a hardship on my family, as it would be for any family and she stated she would get with the escrow department and see if they could help me in any way. XX/XX/XXXX  I left a message for  XXXX  for status with no response.  XX/XX/XXXX I left a message for  XXXX  for status with no response.  XX/XX/XXXX   XXXX  and  XXXX  I left a message for  XXXX , she called back stating she has a supervisor helping her and assured me this would be fixed today. I emailed her directly a letter requesting the amount to be prorated for 48 months as she requested.  XX/XX/XXXX  XXXX  I left a message for  XXXX  for status with no response.  XX/XX/XXXX   XXXX  I left a message for  XXXX   XXXX  she called back and stated it is still pending. She stated they had to reach out to  XXXX   XXXX  co to look into this issue. She put a stop to calls on our late payments and made sure all late fees would continue to be waived. I told her about how I called in  XXXX  with the tax documents and emailed her a copy of who I spoke with and the fax confirmation page. XX/XX/XXXX  XXXX  pm I left a message for  XXXX  for status with no response.  XX/XX/XXXX  my husband received a call from  XXXX  asking for me. He told her to call my phone number and I did n't receive her call for hours even after I tried calling her 3 times. I was told that the escrow amount would be granted for 36 months prorated and my new payments are {$1600.00}. This is still a {$430.00} increase in payments! I told her I still ca n't make those payments and she said she would put in a request to have it re-evaluated for 48 months like I originally requested. She stated she has her supervisors  XXXX   XXXX  and  XXXX   XXXX  helping her in this issue. I got off the phone last night and started doing math. I emailed her this morning,  XX/XX/XXXX  asking for clarification. I am curious where they are getting {$1600.00} from? If {$2000.00} was prorated for 36 months, it should be a {$57.00} increase on our payments. If {$3000.00} is needed to make escrow current ( as  XXXX  stated  XXXX , it should be a {$250.00} increase on our payments. {$57.00} + $  XXXX = {$310.00}. However they are showing an extra {$110.00} added to our payments. We are wondering what the {$110.00} for, as we do not show that amount being accounted for? I do n't understand why we are being put through so much distress for this when it was an error on  Loancare  's behalf and at no fault of our own. We are now 2 months behind on payments because we do n't know our current mortgage payment amount. This ca n't be legal and I am thinking about hiring an attorney. I understand I owe this amount regardless and am willing to do so, I just need them to work with me so I can afford these payments along with cost of living. Please HELP!\",\n",

I told the US Bank representative that I provided all relevant information and was confused as to why US Bank did not attempt to contact me to request this information and resolve this matter instead of denying my claim. After being put on hold for a long time, I was asked for the proof of return information which I provided again, was informed that US Bank will be reopening my claim again, and to wait for a letter in the mail which I had to complete and return. I was also told that I would not be provided provisional credit again for the dispute since they were opening this dispute for a second time which was preposterous since it was not my fault that the bank did not have the information that I provided! \\n\\nI was then contacted by the caseworker from US Bank handling my dispute and was informed that they are now requesting additional \" proof of return \\'\\' of the items and are requesting tracking numbers for the items that were shipped!

When our lender attempted to get a payoff on the NationStar loan, we were told that I am in arrears, and that the loan is not current as the payment per month is {$1500.00} ( not the {$1200.00} that my rep, XXXX XXXX, had quoted me ). After another SEVERAL hours on the phone ( all documented with time stamps ), I have been told that the escrow analysis was never run and that my payment has been short every month since XXXX, the amount of the PMI. They further stated that I will have to come up with an additional {$2500.00} to cover the shortage and that once the loan is purchased/paid in full, I would receive a refund check in that amount as they show in their system as \" pending funds. \\'\\' I finally reached XXXX XXXX ( the original rep I worked with to have this removed ) and ask how this can since he told me that the analysis was run and gave me the amount of the new payment? Needless to say that was over a week ago. He submitted for the escrow analysis XXXX/XXXX/XXXX, had it returned XXXX/XXXX/XXXX, and said my new lower payment of {$1300.00} would start XXXX/XXXX/XXXX. However, after much discussion and noting his mistake, I demanded resolve in showing my account as current through XXXX XXXX as I was making the payment HE quoted me. He said he would get it resolved and call me with the solution - that was XXXX/XXXX/XXXX. I have called and left 8 messages since, and not received ANY communication or call back. During this process I ask \" If my payment was short ( which it was n\\'t ) - why was I never notified of that? \\'\\' The response I received was that no written documentation is sent to people that are currently in Chapter XXXX BK proceedings, regardless of account status. So, I currently sit still with NO answers.',\n",

Key provisions include : Restriction on dual track foreclosure : Mortgage servicers are restricted from advancing the foreclosure process if the homeowner is working on securing a loan modification. When a homeowner completes an application for a loan modification, the foreclosure process is essentially paused until the complete application has been fully reviewed. \\nGuaranteed single point of contact : Homeowners are guaranteed a single point of contact as they navigate the system and try to keep their homes - a person or team at the bank who knows the facts of their case, has their paperwork and can get them a decision about their application for a loan modification. \\nVerification of documents : Lenders that record and file multiple unverified documents will be subject to a civil penalty of up to {$7500.00} per loan in an action brought by a civil prosecutor. Lenders who are in violation are also subject to enforcement by licensing agencies, including the Department XXXX XXXX XXXX, the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. \\nEnforceability : Borrowers will have authority to seek redress of \" material \\'\\' violations of the new foreclosure process protections. Injunctive relief will be available prior to a foreclosure sale and recovery of damages will be available following a sale. ( XXXX XXXX, SB XXXX ) Tenant rights : Purchasers of foreclosed homes are required to give tenants at least 90 days before starting eviction proceedings. If the tenant has a fixed-term lease entered into before transfer of title at the foreclosure sale, the owner must honor the lease unless the owner can prove that exceptions intended to prevent fraudulent leases apply. ( XXXX XXXX ) Tools to prosecute mortgage fraud : The statute of limitations to prosecute mortgage-related crimes is extended from one to three years, allowing the XXXX office to investigate and prosecute complex mortgage fraud crimes. In addition, the XXXX office can use a statewide grand jury to investigate and indict the perpetrators of financial crimes involving victims in multiple counties. \\n( XXXX XXXX, SB XXXX ) Tools to curb blight : Local governments and receivers have additional tools to fight blight caused by multiple vacant homes in their neighborhoods, from more time to allow homeowners to remedy code violations to a means to compel the owners of foreclosed property to pay for upkeep. \\n( XXXX XXXX ) The California Homeowner Bill of Rights marked the third step in XXXX',\n",

However, the statement date is also displayed on the statement. Looking over all my statements in question, it shows that all statements, for subsequent months, are generated prior to the XXXX of the month, most often the XXXX or XXXX. The latest statement date, on my statements in question, was the XXXX. Therefor, even if payment is received by the XXXX or XXXX, it would indicate on the next months statement that the previous months payment was not received, therefor, adding a \" PAST DUE \\'\\' and late fee amount to the next months statement.Therein lies the issue. The late fee is not returned. In my case this occurred four consecutive months, XX/XX/XXXX ( {$140.00} ), XX/XX/XXXX ( {$120.00} ), XX/XX/XXXX ( {$110.00} ) and XX/XX/XXXX ( {$110.00} ).

       " \"Wells Fargo 's requirements for us to fulfill to release funds in escrow changed over time as they were described to us & created more hurdles for us to overcome, making it nearly impossible to access our funds. We purchased the apartment next door so that we could combine the XXXX units & build a bedroom for our baby. Previously, her bedroom was the living room. The Wells Fargo mortgage banker, XXXX XXXX informed us about holding funds in escrow until the wall separating the XXXX units was removed & stove removed with the gas line in XXXX of the XXXX kitchens capped. We were provided with no other requirements. We closed XX/XX/XXXX due to Wells Fargo administrative & mortgage banker issues. We waited until XX/XX/XXXX for the tenant in the new unit to move out. We started our gut renovation project shortly thereafter. We signed XXXX pages of closing documents two days before XX/XX/XXXX & included were clauses allowing Wells Fargo to indefinitely withhold these funds from us, despite what was repeated to us on how simple the requirements were. Who at a real estate closing will read every single page they are signing? In XX/XX/XXXX, XXXX XXXX, a Wells Fargo employee, assigned to monitor the status of the renovation informed us an invoice is needed, plus the wall removal & gas line cap. Per XXXX 's notes, it was not disclosed that an invoice paid in full was required. In XX/XX/XXXX, XXXX informed us for the first time that the invoice from the contractor & paid in full evidence was now a requirement. We explained we needed to wait for the contractor to close permits, plus inspection to be conducted by the architect, & a building board member or superintendent before paying the balance in full. We explained we needed the funds in escrow to pay the final balance. We do not feel comfortable paying the full balance to the contractor before all inspections are complete for fear there are issues that need to be addressed & we no longer have any incentive for the contractor to fix any issues. We now need the funds in escrow to pay the full balance because we have no funds. The contract states the construction would be completed within XXXX weeks. As of XXXX XXXX, 2015 we are now in week 28.5 of the project. The contractor extorted us for more money & threatened to both put a lien on our property & report us to DOB if we did not pay. We 've been out of a kitchen for over XXXX months & counting, due to the renovation. We 've been forced to purchase all of our meals. Regardless of why we need the escrow funds released, we fulfilled all of the original requirements Wells Fargo provided. When we requested a list of requirements in XX/XX/XXXX, we were not provided any official documentation. We were introduced to a new requirement to be fulfilled. We spoke with XXXX XXXX & asked her to help us navigate this outstanding issue. She informed us what will be required is evidence that a significant portion of the costs covered, plus the invoice. This would indicate most of the work was completed & paid for. We provided a copy of the contract, displaying the full scope of work & cost. We forwarded copies of all bank checks cashed by the contractor. We currently owe 5 % of the contract cost. This is insufficient for Wells Fargo to release our funds from escrow. We feel Wells Fargo is creating more requirements at their will, making it difficult for us to access our funds & not being transparent. As you can imagine, when a construction project runs over by XXXX weeks, with missing materials that need to be re-purchased, & a contractor who is purposely slowing the pace of work down, the last thing we need is the bank to renege on its original word of the conditions by which our funds would be withheld from us.\",\n",

When I gave Chase the money to get ahead several months I could of taken that money and done something else But I chose to pay Chase my house payments early. To show them Im serious about my home. Now Chase is telling me my house payment is going to increase Because of no funds in my escrow account. How is this possible especailly when Chase was paid several months ahead. I do not think Chase is handling my account correctly or handling it professionally ( escrow account and mortage ). All I want / need is to please drop my interest rate.They will not help me.\",\n",

       " \"This is actually a very complicated complaint with a long list since I only just recently learned about this. I have had nothing but issues from the company and have since been kicked out of my home wrongfully and need help to try to get back in it. I would really prefer to talk with someone as the list is very long. I will briefly describe here. \\nIt really truly started when getting the loan in XX/XX/XXXX. I was told we would be in by XXXX, then it became XXXX, then XXXX. I barely got into it right before XXXX. I had over 10 % down and was told I wouldn't have PMI insurance. The company said oh we still charge it for the first five years. During parts of the loan financial issues were experienced and I asked to look at a refinance and was told we wont help and no one will. I also told them one time when a payment was a few days late that I could pay 1/3 of the payment that day but wouldn't be able to pay the remaining amount until the end of the week. They wouldn't take my payment saying that wont do anything. I started not receiving monthly bills instead received them maybe every couple months. Fast forwarding to XX/XX/XXXX, I sent a payment and realized after it was mailed that my bank account had been hacked. I called them explaining what happened and asked if they could hold the check. They started that they had not received the check and they couldn't hold it. Before I could get it cancelled with my bank, they cashed it and received payment but had my account severely over drafted. I during this year received foreclosure paperwork stating that i was six months behind which i knew wasn't true because i had recently switched jobs and cashed in retirement to fill in any down period of money flow. I paid them the amount that they were claiming and never saw anything on my bill about foreclosure fees which were totaling XXXX. I continue to make payments and inXX/XX/XXXX receive further foreclosure papers stating that I was once again six months behind. This again was not true. I had receipts to back it up. I explained this and they said well we never received it. So I pay them what they are claiming is owed. I emailed them asking if I could work out lawyer fees since all of a sudden the old ones appear on a bill that I received in my sporadic Bill 's being mailed. I was told absolutely. When trying to work out something they refused to do it saying that they wouldn't. I would email them so that I would have proof of conversations and all of a sudden during this they no longer communicate through emails. They refused to accept my payments once I tried tonwork out lawyer fees with them and claim that that's not what they said. Their documentation of conversations has proven to be very sketchy at best. During the loan, I would get calls from them but it was for a completely different person. I'm not n.j sure if they were applying my payments to this person or what. They also let my house insurance lapse and I had to find new insurance. So in the not accepting payments, they bought the home in foreclosure and evicted me when they refused to accept my payment. I tried to find a lawyer during all of this. Every lawyer said this is a case and a complicated one but no one would take it. After they bought the house, I knew nothing of it and qould still receive spontaneous bills up until XX/XX/XXXX when they informed me that they had bought it and were evicting me. I asked them what it would cost to stop this since they haven't wanted to work with me at all. They tell me two days before I was supposed to be out a price and expect it to be there the next day. Which of course was insane so they kicked me out. There is more that I just am not thinking of right now. They have also gone through and change reports that are as far back as two years old on my credit trying to make it look bad in me. They, at one pontx correctly reported the payments that they claimed I hadn't made and changed them later to look like I didn't make them. They are also still filing against my credit after they evicted me saying that I'm over 150 days behind on payments, XX/XX/XXXX currently shows me as being 150 days late. They are doing some extremely crooked and fishy things that need to be stopped. This has apparently happened to others as well looking at this site.\",\n",

       " \"XX/XX/XXXX someone backed into me in a crowded parking lot and since my car was unable to drive safely the party at faults insurance company was paying for a rental car. I had a meeting I had to attend before the claim number was able to clear the rental. I made a reservation at the local XXXX for a regular small car like a Camry ( do n't really remember type of car ) which was, I 'm told, unavailable after I had arrived and it promised. I was then offered a vehicle which had just come back in and had not been cleaned or gassed up and would I mind and then I should just bring it back the same way. I told them as long as the insurance company would pay for it that I did not want anything they were not going to pay for. I was assured that the cost of the rental would be the same as the vehicle promised and that meant the insurance company would be fine. I gave them the claim number and let them know the insurance company would not have the rental car formally approved for 24-48 hours and they asked if I had a card to secure it I told them I would give them the card number only if they agree to take {$50.00}. off and return it as soon as claim number cleared. The number cleared within less than 24 hours and I assumed all was well at that time. During this exchange I had made the statement 2 or 3 times that only what the insurance company was paying for while they try to up sell insurance and bigger better vehicles. They received a resounding NO! When my car was done approximately 48 hours later I saw the debit on my card for {$600.00}. I went down to the XXXX office I had rented from and XXXX of the XXXX people that was present at the time it was rented was there. When I told him what had happened he went and got his manager out of the back. After about XXXX hours I asked him well what were the charges for. Expecting to hear that there was some mistake I get back from him it was for insurance that was not required and gas {$80.00}. for gas.I then asked if he could show me a copy of whatever gave them the idea that I requested unnecessary insurance and since I picked up the vehicle with no gas that 's how i was told to return it.After another hour or so I asked if he found it and he was still looking for it. I verified they closed at XXXX that day and I had to go but call me by the end of the day with an update and if I did n't hear from him I would report it to my bank as an unauthorized debit which is what I did on XXXX/XXXX/2016. After a couple of calls asking why it had not been credited back they finally did so on XXXX/XXXX/2016. On XXXX XXXX I noticed it had been deducted again so I called at least half a dozen times looking for answers I emailed them and until yesterday had no idea what was going on. On at least XXXX occasions was told they had mailed it to me and all I had received was a letter thanking me for notifying them of my address change which was done on the XX/XX/XXXX phone call. Yesterday I received a call from XXXX in Texas who tells me they had determined it was a merchandiser dispute and to take it up with them. XXXX nor anyone else I spoke to had any idea what the circumstances were until I told them furthermore just because they consider this a dispute with the merchandiser it still is an obvious unauthorized debit and instead of them playing judge and I 'm their customer in long standing with them and this being the first problem instead of me being told to take it up with the merchant it should be them telling the merchant they need to take it up with me. I 'm at a loss what do I do now? How do I get my money back? Do I have to take them to small claims court?

Therefore, it is formally requested that assistance be provided by Sir/Madam of XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX, and all its agents or employees in closing the matters timely and quickly. Appendix A is the OVERVIEW of what we discovered that the bank has done with the NOTE, that the fact is the NOTE is our promise to pay, XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX, hereafter referred to as the Alleged Bank/Lender ( s ) /Servicer ( s ), has monetized our NOTE and turned it into a cash item, and used the Deed of Trust as security for the NOTE. As a result, the Alleged Bank/Lender ( s ) /Servicer ( s ) did not loan its own assets, it loaned credit, a FRAUD, FRAUD IN THE INDUCEMENT, FAILURE OF CONSIDERATION, CONSTRUCTIVE FRAUD, done in CONSPIRACY, an utterly void and without value transaction. All of this is supported and shown by escrow documents as detailed under Appendix B. Appendix C will show the core issue that there is no contract with the Alleged Bank/Lender ( s ) /Servicer ( s ), and will also show the reasons that there is no standing or capacity for the Alleged Bank/Lender ( s ) /Servicer ( s ) ; which leads to our conclusion that the Alleged Bank/Lender ( s ) /Servicer ( s ) has no entitlement, no legal protections without the production of the contract exhibiting all the necessary requirements of a contract by operation of law.

This letter offers release for what could be found to be illegal acts. This letter provides opportunity for all parties to mortgage # XXXX ( XXXX XXXX XXXX. XXXX ) and # XXXX ( XXXX XXXX, XXXX. ) to be made whole. Failure by Alleged Bank/Lender ( s ) /Servicer ( s ) to act will be recorded as fact showing intent to deceive, fraud, conversion and other felonies by bank officers. This is simply because the corporation, Alleged Bank/Lender ( s ) /Servicer ( s ) is incapable of felony as it is merely a piece of paper. SYNOPSIS We made mistakes in relying on certain acts by Sir/Madam and XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX Our reliance was done in contact with professionals operating the mortgage/bank systems. In short, our reliance was induced under professional standard, in our expectation of good faith and clean hands. Since we discovered these errors, a choice to believe said errors are founded on mistakes is foundational for this instrument. In the event Sir/Madam of XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX chooses to assist in correction of these mistakes, the following will make us whole and exhibit clean hands by XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX 1. The Deed of Trust is cleared of any claim by XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX with the transfer of clean title back to XXXX XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX XXXX. 2. The cash/current funds expended during purchase of XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, California, XXXX including of all outlays and payments is to be reimbursed by XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX 3. We will issue a new XXXX XXXX for the full value of the purchase price and all expenses in favor of XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX with a new XXXX A abandoning those funds to XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX ( Or, in the alternative, issue release of those funds via letter of instruction. ) 4. The parties agree to hold the other harmless for all acts and omissions prior or future ; unless new evidence of a compelling nature is disclosed. It is believed these four ( 4 ) items will make both parties whole in an open transparent manner which corrects all mistakes by any party. Counter presentments are welcome so long as both parties are closed as to liabilities. Again, please advise us if there is anything incorrect or unfair in what is stated herein. Be advised that in the event these issues are not settled in a reasonable amount of time, seven ( 7 ) days seems appropriate, we will take all appropriate action. In contemplation of corruption of these issues and to prevent abuse of process, this instrument is placed in a time vault, on the World Wide Web ready for massive dissemination. We look forward to resolving the exposed mistakes timely and quickly. Done this XX/XX/XXXX, as stated under pains and penalties of perjury under the laws of the United States of America and the State of California. Appendix A OVERVIEW 1. NOTE is our promise to pay at a future time, labor backing both the NOTE and all current funds circulating as currency. 2. Monetizing or securitizing the NOTE turns it into a cash item. 3. Deed of Trust is security for the NOTE. Trust law reverses rules of evidence, Trustee must prove good faith, full disclosure and proper procedures for operations. 4. Escrow is the transfer point between seller, buyer, Title Company, so called lender, where the NOTE is exchanged for deed. 5. Alleged Bank/Lender ( s ) /Servicer ( s ), issued check to escrow under internal request procedure. At time of issuing audits will expose that there is no evidence verifying : a ) source of money ; b ) owned by bank ; c ) at time, or later, of issuing check, all of which is available as proof via public records of corporation. 6. Alleged Bank/Lender ( s ) /Servicer ( s ) issued NSF ( non-sufficient funds ) check. 7. Alleged Bank/Lender ( s ) /Servicer ( s ) never possessed the NOTE until after transfer between seller and buyer, deed for check. 8. Deed of Trust executed at closing of escrow is security for the NOTE. 9. Alleged Bank/Lender ( s ) /Servicer ( s ) later records as sent, NOTE to offset the liability of check. 10. Alleged Bank/Lender ( s ) /Servicer ( s ) records, audited statement, shows conclusively that Alleged Bank/Lender ( s ) /Servicer ( s ), loaned credit, buyers credit, which took place at escrow closing. 11. Alleged Bank/Lender ( s ) /Servicer ( s ) did not loan its own assets, it loaned credit, not even theirs, an ultra vires act, illegal under law and regulating authorities. A FRAUD, FRAUD IN THE INDUCEMENT, FAILURE OF CONSIDERATION, CONSTRUCTIVE FRAUD, done in CONSPIRACY, ISSUE A FRAUDULENT SECURITY, an utterly void and without value transaction. 12. Transfer of Title to registry systems or second servicer is fraudulent. 13. Bank claims abandoned funds after three ( 3 ) years. This is double payment and never disclosed. 14. Deed of Trust is fraudulent, resulting in defective Title, unmarketable title. Appendix B Each of these statements is shown by escrow documents. The Alleged Bank/Lender ( s ) /Servicer ( s ), or so called lenders acts are shown as follows : 1. Balance sheet relating to the original loan, shows ledgering of the account as required to be reported and open knowledge under 12 USC 242, 347 and proved by XXXX reports available from IRS. 2. The XXXX XXXX prospect reports shows filing facts concerning the security issued under the note and Deed of Trust without reporting bases of the derivative. 3. Securities and Exchange Commission Reports S 3 A shows the sale of the note and form of item sold. 4. FASB ( Financial Accounting Standards Board ) forms 125, 133, 140, 5, 95 guides an auditor to the liability side of the banks books, exposing exactly where the money came from and shows where it went and under what procedure and instrument. 5. The NOTE as negotiable instrument falls under UCC. 6. There is never a receipt given for the deposit of value. 7. 12 USC 1813 ( L ) ( I ) discloses that deposit of a promissory note is cash to the Alleged Bank/Lender ( s ) /Servicer ( s ). The Alleged Bank/Lender ( s ) /Servicer ( s ) s cash is our cash, not the Alleged Bank/Lender ( s ) /Servicer ( s ) ; the proof is the bogus loan paper. 8. There was never a receipt issued for the cash deposit. 9. The notes transferred at a transaction account creates an asset on the payable side of the ledger ; while on the liability side of the ledger, the NOTE issued by the presumed buyer/borrower is sold after monetizing. 10. First funds transfer or hold absolute right to the NOTE or cash equivalent. 11. XXXX XXXX identifies the principal issuer. Deed of trust is required to be registered as evidence of debt. Notes are not so required. Sale of unregistered security sets up right of rescission as a property right absolute. Conclusion based on evidence publicly available is that the transaction between buyer and Alleged Bank/Lender ( s ) /Servicer ( s ) is a fraud. The mistake may have resulted from standard practice, procedures, application on part of Alleged Bank/Lender ( s ) /Servicer ( s ) or, it may not. In either instance the predicate facts are result in the issues herein. Appendix C In Appendix B, we discovered that the whole mortgage was a fraud from the beginning. XXXX XXXX discovered the core issue is that there is no contract with the bank, there is no standing or capacity for the Alleged Bank/Lender ( s ) /Servicer ( s ), its agents and its servicers because : 1. We have no contract with the Alleged Bank/Lender ( s ) /Servicer ( s ). 2. The Alleged Bank/Lender ( s ) /Servicer ( s ) never placed on the files of this matter its corporate delegation, or its minutes authorizing to entry into a contract with us. 3. There is no officer identified with corporate authority attached or corporate authority to engage a contract with us. 4. The corporate charter for Alleged Bank/Lender ( s ) /Servicer ( s ) does not authorize its taking of our note to fund a Alleged Bank/Lender ( s ) /Servicer ( s ) s liability, escrow check, exchanged for issuers, our note, obligation to pay at close of escrow on specific time line. 5. The Alleged Bank/Lender ( s ) /Servicer ( s ) issued a NSF ( non-sufficient funds ) check to escrow prior to having possession of the assets, NOTE issued by us. 6. The Alleged Bank/Lender ( s ) /Servicer ( s ) s charter, state law and federal law do not authorize Alleged Bank/Lender ( s ) /Servicer ( s ) to lend credit, no matter the source of the credit. 7. The Alleged Bank/Lender ( s ) /Servicer ( s ) s charter limits the Alleged Bank/Lender ( s ) /Servicer ( s ) to specific acts ; all acts outside its legal or corporate authority being ultra vires, of no effect, utterly void. In this matter, the payments made by us to the Alleged Bank/Lender ( s ) /Servicer ( s ) were induced under fraud, the illegal acts above, which voids any claim by Alleged Bank/Lender ( s ) /Servicer ( s ). The creation of debt by lenders, the Deed of Trust and Promissory Note, payment of or agreement to pay money to the debtor, the Alleged Bank/Lender ( s ) /Servicer ( s ), or to a third party for account of debtor, the Alleged Bank/Lender ( s ) /Servicer ( s ), is not a contract. Assumption of contract being in place for collection process requires that the contract be produced ; it is never produced because there is no contract. The creation of debt by a credit to an account with the lender, Deed of Trust and Promissory Note, upon which the debtor, the Alleged Bank/Lender ( s ) /Servicer ( s ), is entitled to draw immediately such as the NSF check exchange for the NOTE, does not create a contract nor obligation. Failure by Alleged Bank/Lender ( s ) /Servicer ( s ) to produce bona fide contract is admission to inducement to part with valuable consideration in exchange for nothing but a different instrument. None the less, the only value issued is by us, which is able to be shown through Alleged Bank/Lender ( s ) /Servicer ( s ) documents which are public record, audits and corporate reports. We will, if needed, subpoena the records mentioned above in order to prove the points herein. The Alleged Bank/Lender ( s ) /Servicer ( s ) appears to have failed : to operate under these legal principals, covered by, UCC , the laws governing consumer credit and usury, the providing of rate ceilings to assure adequate supply of credit to consumers ; to educate consumers for understanding the terms of credit transactions ; to keep so called lenders honest through competition for credit at reasonable cost ; to protect so called consumers against illegal acts ; to keep fair and sound consumer credit practices ; to comply with FEDERAL TRUTH IN LENDING ACT ; and to equalize all jurisdictions. Consumers in the above context are XXXX XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX XXXX. In reality the Alleged Bank/Lender ( s ) /Servicer ( s ),  XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX the consumer of our credit, who issued that product, the NOTE, promise to pay, representing labor as the source of value. The Alleged Bank/Lender ( s ) /Servicer ( s ) did not provide the goods, the NOTE or the labor backing it, did not manufacture the credit represented by the NOTE. None the less, the user of the product, the NOTE representing real value, labor is the buyer of the NOTE through a fraudulent inducement as outlined above, which is the Alleged Bank/Lender ( s ) /Servicer ( s ). The Alleged Bank/Lender ( s ) /Servicer ( s )  as outlined herein has no entitlement, no legal protections without production of the contract exhibiting all the necessary requirements of a contract by operation of law. No contract, no standing. No standing, no claim. No claim, no defense.',\n",

The representative told me that their system could not accommodate such a request as they can not differentiate between DLSCNS Sequence 1 and DLUCNS Sequence 2 under the same consolidation when applying an extra payment. They did advise me that I could submit a letter with standing instructions to allocate the payments as desired and the payment would be reallocated after the fact. \\n\\nOn XX/XX/XXXX, I submitted a letter [ Attachment 1 ] with standing instructions which indicate that any additional payments made toward my XXXX XXXX XXXX Federal Direct Loans be first applied to DLUCNS Sequence 2 until that loan is paid in full. \\n\\nOn XX/XX/XXXX, XXXX XXXX replied with a letter [ Attachment 2 ] approving my standing instructions. \\n\\nLater in XXXX of XXXX, I changed my direct debit information to pay an additional {$270.00} to my XXXX XXXX XXXX Federal Direct Loans.

On Tuesday XX/XX/XXXX I went to my local branch at XXXX, SC, XXXX phone XXXX. I talked to a Branch Team Member XXXX. I requested that my current checking account be closed and I opened a new one. I gave her a list of items I wanted paid and left just enough money in the account so those Items would clear. Also a month earlier I opted out of over draft and ach/ech protection and instructed her not to pay any other items presented, pretty clear cut instructions and she said she under stood. I also deposited {$20.00} in my new account the next day my wife came in to put her name on the account and deposit {$300.00} she was told an item that was not on the list was paid and that she owed {$10.00} more dollars.I contacted XXXX and she politely told me that they could not close my account until all the Items cleared. I asked if I could talk to her supervisor she gave me a phone # where I was told to leave a message no one ever called back. On the morning of the XX/XX/XXXX I went online and found I was charged overdraft fees of {$36.00}, {$36.00}, and {$72.00} to cover other Items I did not authorize. I contacted XXXX on the phone and asked her how much I needed to deposit to close my account for good so no more transactions would be processed she said {$620.00} I deposited over {$800.00} and thought the matter had been taken care of for good. Today I went online and found they processed another item out of my old account and charged me a {$72.00} overdraft fee. I called to talk to XXXX and she would not take my call i explained my story to a teller she told me my account would be closed tonight and I would have a positive balance of about {$60.00} on Wensday XX/XX/XXXX.At the least this is the worst example of customer service I have ever seen. However I think they may even be in violation of some consumer protection laws for one I was opted out of over draf protect but still charged over {$300.00} in over drat fees to cover items that did not even amount to that much.

Saturday morning XXXX, XXXX I went to the XXXX MA police department to file a report, there was some uncertainty as to which police department I should be filing the report with because my business is located in XXXX, but the branch is located in XXXX NH.

We have written a time line and can provide whatever documents that is needed as well as a Professional Witness to verify our claims. Our loan was F.H.A. We initially were trying to get Down Payment Assistance. Throughout the whole agonizing process, we never dropped the ball on our end with paperwork. We were told per our Loan Officer ( XXXX # XXXX ) that I could start my part time hours the following week since I was notified mid-week about the status change that was needed. So, I continued the week with the schedule. On XX/XX/XXXX, I submitted my check stub to verify employment. I was told at XXXX ( The Day before closing ) that The Underwriter sent our file to an investigating level due to me making more hours. Ultimately the decision was that we were committing Fraud and we can not get Down Payment Assistance PERIOD!

( After Closing I was told that The Down Payment assistance is done at the beginning of the process there was no reason my check stub should have prevented us from receiving Down Payment Assistance. This leads me to believe that our application was never submitted and the story about our file being flagged was just a way to prolong the strained situation. ) She gave no explanation or no apology to her misinforming me. She actually boasted \" That she does not work for free that we are going to close \\'\\' \" She also boasted that \" She DOES NOT do the numbers, that going over them was a courtesy \\'\\'. We were completely misled about what to do during the process. I was verbally scolded by XXXX, apparently, my tone was too dry for her liking which that conversation ended with me hanging up. I was not going to argue with her. XXXX needs to understand that her fast talking is not a good trait to have and her answers are very important if she is unaware of the answer to a question it \\'s okay to get back with the Future Home Owner. Her misspeaking prevented us from getting down payment assistance, and made us lose my 4.3 % interest rate, and in turn we had to pay approx. XXXX to close. My realtor asked XXXX did we need to make an amendment for us to receive the XXXX that was promised by the Sellers in the contract she said no. The result of that was us only getting XXXX from the sellers, XXXX less than what was LEGALLY PROMISED and XXXX more that we had to pay. Also, the Underwriter supposedly went over my application more than once, it took the Title Company to find the discrepancy in the numbers and at the last minute we were told we had to bring an additional amount to the table. We did not go over any numbers until we sat at the table to close. The Title Company gave us the numbers. XXXX stated that \" XXXX ( Realtor ) could go over the numbers she could n\\'t she had to pick up her son \\'\\'. My Loan Officer did not give us that \" LUXURY \\'\\'.

In short, the agency, whom we had also purchased travel insurance through, under a separate name, XXXX XXXX, made our flight reservations, sent us the itinerary, then with no notification changed our return flight resulting in us missing our flight home and being delayed 36 hours and having considerable additional expense for hotel, food and incidentals. The agency of course refused to rectify anything, attempting to blame XXXX for the change, this went on for several months when we were finally able to obtain written proof from XXXX that the change was made by XXXX XXXX XXXX and not the airline. Proof was provided to American Express and the charges for the travel agency \\'s fee of {$780.00} were reversed with the agency not disputing the reversal. Clearly they couldn\\'t as XXXX had in writing refuted their bogus claim and provided a copy of the change made by them. Yet the cost of the insurance purchase through XXXX XXXX XXXX ( see attached receipt for {$390.00} ) which was billed separately by them under the name of XXXX XXXX was denied for \\'untimely filing \\' and \\'no response from the merchant \\'. Since when can a merchant ignore a claim and come out on top of the dispute process??? Multiple calls have been made to American Express explaining this is from the same original dispute, is the same company with an alias name, and proof has been provided of the insurance charge as well as the expenses that resulted in {$630.00} out of pocket due to the blatant negligence of the agency changing our flight with no notification and then attempting to lie their way out of any responsibility. In speaking with an American Express supervisor, XXXX, after the XXXX denial of the XXXX XXXX charge, she assured me that she fully understood the situation, that notes were made to the account and that we should submit an additional letter clarifying the situation, once again, to American Express so they could \" resolve things in our favor \\'\\'.

No amount of calls, letters, documentation, etc seems to reach the ears of these people. It has been explained over and over that the original dispute was filed almost immediately, but that it was the delay of American Express, XXXX, and the agency that led to the delay in us finally getting confirmation needed to prove that the agency was outright lying and had pocketed a fee for insurance as well as a service fee for booking our flight and then changing it with no notice resulting in considerable expense and inconvenience for us. Because the charges were billed separately American Express can not seem to understand this. It is obvious the disputes department ignores all proof, and finds it easiest to simply send out form letters over and over rather than doing the right thing. In truth, because we purchased these tickets/insurance/ and services through American Express XXXX American Express travel insurance should be responsible as well, which we have noted in several conversations, yet we are encouraged to pursue the dispute process and then wrongly denied.

On XXXX XXXX, XXXX, while working I swerved to miss a deer, my load was top heavy and it caused my XXXX to roll. Following the accident, I was unable to work.

They sent me an application to fill out and requested a bunch of financial documentation from me.I put everything together and sent everything they asked for, however, they claim they did n\\'t received it, so I sent it to them again. Then they claimed that things were missing, so I sent everything again. I ended up sending in the same documentation to Loancare three times and then they closed my file. Without letting me know, on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX, Loancare filed a Notice of Default against my property and I was bombarded by marketing from Attorneys and Real Estate Agents. Loancare did n\\'t even have the common courtesy to call and let me know that my file was still incomplete or send me a letter advising the documents they were missing. Once I found out about the notice of default, I called Loancare, but they refused to speak with me and that I had to \" speak with their attorney \\'\\'.

Since Loancare would not speak to me and their attorney wanted the full amount due, I was forced to file for bankruptcy as the only way for certain that I could stop the foreclosure sale.

I \\'ve tried getting help both from Loancare and from the non-profit housing agency, and neither of them helped me at all. I have done my own research on my options, and have learned a lot and have determined that I have been severely mistreated by Loancare. Here is what I learned : ( 1 ) FHA has an unemployment program that I was never told about, and was never offered to me. Why? I was struggling and never knew this was an option. ( 2 ) I should have a single point of contact at Loancare. I never got one. Every time I spoke with Loancare I had to speak to a different person. ( 3 ) When the Notice of Default was recorded, they could have still evaluated me for hardship relief. Instead, they told me to talk with their Attorney. ( 4 ) FHA offers several different options to help me keep my home, and Loancare has never told me about nor reviewed my loan for any of them. ( 5 ) Loancare was suppose to evaluate my file and inform me in writing of any outcome. I never received a call, let alone anything in writing. My wife and I are back on our financial feet and can afford our house payment and I struggle to understand how to resolve my crisis and need some help.

In XX/XX/XXXX we actually made a deal for a broker to sell it, I agreed in XX/XX/XXXX to pay him {$10000.00} upon successful sale. His name was XXXX XXXX and he ultimately sold the boat for the bank. We made the payment in XX/XX/XXXX and reached out to Bank Of America in early XX/XX/XXXX advising that we were not going to be able to make the XX/XX/XXXX payment. I advised that I was selling the boat and even offered to share the advertising but they had little or no interest in giving us any breathing room. They assigned a specialist and we talked XX/XX/XXXX, XXXX. We spoke on several occasions as with others when XXXX was n't available and all they ever wanted was to collect payment, no efforts to try and help with ever growing pressure to pay up or else. I was n't always available when BofA called but I did always call back.XX/XX/XXXX I got a call from the XXXX XXXX salesman I 've know for years that BofA was sniffing around to repo the boat. I called the broker and said time was of the essence, he called me a few days later and said he had a buyer but I told him I could not get the bank to hold off without cash. On a boat this size in the dead of winter you just do n't buy it sign unseen or without a survey. I could not get BofA to hold off and In the dead of winter, with almost 2 feet of snow on the ground and the boat locked in by at least 7 other boats they spent the money to have the marina move the boats so repo company could get to the boat and take it which they did XX/XX/XXXX and moved it down the road a few blocks to another, much smaller marina but with a fenced in yard. On XX/XX/XXXX XXXX confirmed he had a cash buyer looking to buy the boat at the price I was asking, {$290000.00}. I spent two weeks trying to get anyone to talk to me to get access to the boat sooner than later as I heard they repo company typically moved the boat to Ohio, another expense that they did not need to incur on my behalf. I finally got approval to show the boat with XXXX to his buyer and they loved the boat. There were some items I had left on the boat that were missing, it took me a few weeks to find those items and commit to the buyer that those items would be returned to the boat ( lines, fenders, grill, life jackets, flairs etc ). Shortly after through the local marina and XXXX XXXX XXXX and BofA unkown to me they advised XXXX to no longer deal with me and deal with XXXX XXXX. During the next week no one would talk to me, XXXX gave me tidbits that they were buying the boat but would n't say price or anything else. XXXX updated me on XX/XX/XXXX that the survey was done with only some minor issues and his buyer was buying the boat. I later learned after many calls that they sold the boat for {$250000.00}. That 's {$49000.00} below what the broker told may they would pay and with all the equipment we had added market value would support. This boat was meticulously maintained by the marina who maintained it since it was new, it was in fantastic shape. \\nAs they continued to spend money they did n't need to, the move, the repo company, the commissions they paid they finally advised me that I still owed {$41000.00} after the sale of the boat. I do not think they needed to act so quickly, they should have let me at least carry on with the buyer and I would have been able to pay it off and maybe make some money beyond what I owned BofA.

When I have called, it was to resolve the issue of them increasing my escrow payment based on an incorrect estimation based on previous year \\'s taxes despite documentation provided. They recognize that it is incorrect and say they are escalating the issue ; it hasn\\'t been escalated. Their response before XX/XX/XXXX was \" you have to provide a bill for us to change the escrow \\'\\'.

Further, SLS failed to state the \" applicable requirements \\'\\' for XXXX XX/XX/2005 as required by RESPA Section 1024.41 ( d ) 1. \\n\\nMy loan modification appeal letters and Qualified Written Request actually stated the requirements and guidelines in the pooling and servicing agreement and what modifications that allowed. In SLS seven response letters to my letters, they never even acknowledged that each of my letters cited the PSA and proved what my mortgage investors requirements were. Each SLS letter repeated that they had to follow the investors requirements, could not do otherwise, and had made available all the loan modifications my investors allow. So they ignored the facts, never discussed those facts and repeated in a non-responsive way their position. \\n\\nSLS has never acknowledge or discussed directly their violation of Section 1024.41 ( d ) 1 I mentioned. Instead, they would refer to clauses in RESPA and Regulation X that said they did n\\'t have to disclose anything about the PSA. Their responses used the original language of RESPA before it was amended and failed to account for what the CFPB said in its interpretation of the final rules that were published in the Federal Register. Once again, they would not directly discuss an issue presented and used boilerplate language which was not relevant or had been amended to justify their non-responsive position. \\n\\nWhat started out as my attempt to have SLS offer me a loan modification my mortgage investor allows and approves of, turned into something greater. Through SLS letters to me and my six responses which total 46 pages, SLS demonstrated in its responses that what it was saying to me is most likely how it deals with all loan modification applicants and all borrowers. So this complaint is not just about my loan. It is about all loans serviced by SLS that are not guaranteed by the federal government. Based on how they incorrectly apply RESPA and their use of repetitive answers which are non-responsive to facts and issues presented, there is a high probability this reflects how SLS deals with all borrowers. \\n\\nI have read RESPA and Regulation X, the CFPB interpretations of the final rules published in the Federal Register, the Mortgage Settlement Act, California law, U.S. trust law, pooling and servicing agreements, and studied th operations and structure of the mortgage servicing industry. I have also talked with attorneys and other experts about all this including an attorney who works for the XXXX.

SLS failed to meet the burden of offering all the loss mitigation options the investor allows as the CFPB requires. SLS failed to state the applicable requirements of XXXX XX/XX/2005 that RESPA Section 1024.41 ( d ) 1 requires. SLS falsely stated that it is following the requirements of XXXX XX/XX/2005 when it is not and evidence has been presented to prove it is not.

Without any notification being sent to my actual email address that there was new communication only sent directly to the AES website under my account, I would have never seen this communication. This communication was sent to my AES Success account on XX/XX/XXXX. I should have received an email to my personal email that this important change in terms was sent to the AES website and would need to be reviewed. \\n\\nI was emailed on XX/XX/XXXX as usual that my account was due for a payment on XX/XX/XXXX, without ANY DOLLAR AMOUNT ON IT or any verbiage that the amount would be different than I have been paying for months. Then on Saturday XX/XX/XXXX I received an email reminder that I had an upcoming payment due - and THIS is where I was advised that {$240.00} is my monthly installment amount. I had been paying an additional {$50.00} on my {$100.00} monthly installment amount previously, and this {$50.00} was also added to the total that would be withdrawn on XX/XX/XXXX now totaling {$290.00}. \\n\\nThe update sent only to my AES account, and the latest email on XX/XX/XXXX does NOT detail why there is an increase in my monthly payment amount. The individual on the phone I spoke to this morning advised me that the promissory note was redisclosed (?? ) and that due to this, there is now an increase in the monthly payment. The document states an interest rate of 1.875 % and for my installment amount, and a new combined monthly payment of {$240.00}. This amount is being listed as what will be taken out of my account through direct debit now. However, when I pointed out to this individual that my loans have a fixed rate of 1.625 %, they advised that no, I do still have this fixed rate through direct debit, and that now more money will be paid towards my balance. How does that make sense, that more money will be taken out of my account and a higher interest rate showing on this new repayment summary? Why is there even a different amount showing on this document, where is there any mention of any promissory note anything and the breakdown as to exactly how these payments that have increased over 50 % are justified? The letter states \" Why We Are Contacting You - There has been a change in the repayment terms for the loans listed on the reverse side of this letter. Conditions such as granting a deferment or forbearance, a change in interest rate and interest capitalization ( adding interest to the principal balance of your loans ) are examples of what may have caused the terms of your loans to be recalculated. \\'\\' I do not see verbiage of a promissory note, loan re-disclosure, anything within this document. \\n\\nPlease review the emails attached, all transactions of loans detailing payments, and the \" update \\'\\' that was only sent to the AES website to my account on XX/XX/XXXX.',\n",

Nowhere in the letter did it say what the amount of our new payment would be. For about 60 months we have been paying interest and some toward principal. The new payment was to begin on XX/XX/XXXX. XX/XX/XXXX & XX/XX/XXXX I called SLS and the person that I talked to had no idea what I was talking about. So, on XX/XX/XXXX I called again and again the person I talked to said he was n't aware of what I was talking about so I asked him what my minimum payment would be for XX/XX/XXXX and he said {$64.00} and change which is just the interest on the loan.

We are in the process of trying to refinance our home and SLS is considering those payment sent in XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX as late payments. which will disqualify us from obtaining a refi.

Over the course of that relationship this institution has made changes to its policies, procedures, and promotions.\\n\\nThese changes usually do not affect our operation but in the few instances where they have, we\\'d visit a local banking center and come up with alternative solutions. While these solutions would vary, the common goal was to ensure that the services we received were comparable to what was in place prior to the change. \\n\\nRecently, one change has been made for which there is no comparable alternative. Earlier this year we began to see a number of fees appearing on our accounts. The fees we were charged for were \" monthly maintenance fees \\'\\' and \" Overdraft transfer fees \\'\\'. When we contacted the bank we were told that these are typical fees that we had always been charged and that nothing had changed. After escalating the issue, we had two different supervisors claim that the only difference was that we were just now noticing the fees.\\n\\nWe were able to convince the last supervisor we had to look through our account to verify that there was no such history of us being charged theses fees. He found that in the months prior we were not charged a maintenance fee. He also found several instances where funds were automatically transferred from one account to the other with no overdraft transfer fee. Although he was able to verify our claim, he stated that there must have been some mistake with the system that was behind the reason we weren\\'t being charged.\\n\\nWe later discovered that the system was issuing the charge but immediatley crediting the account in the same amount. This prompted the supervisor to do a little more research and it was ultimately discovered that there had been a change earlier in the year that removed a \" perk \\'\\' that kept us from incurring these fees.\\n\\nThe supervisor apologized for all of the calls that we had to make to discover this information and said that our account would be credited for any of the fees that we had not already been issued a courtesy credit on. After completing the credit, we were then advised that we would need to visit a banking center to discuss options on opening different accounts that would afford us the same benefits that we had before this change.\\n\\nWe attempted to follow this instruction but was stymied in the process as we discovered that Bank of America no longer offers any account without fees unless you meet new criteria that was established when they made this change. We\\'ve since continued to incur these fees.\\n\\nI can not force Bank of America to change its policy and understand that it\\'s our responsibility to find a bank that does offer services that line up with how we operate.

As of today, I still do not see any positive changes on my credit report to reverse the damage XXXX Nationstar Mr. Cooper have done to my credit and credit score by continued lack of reporting all payments that have been made since XX/XX/2016 as well reversing the damage they have caused by intentional misreporting regarding my VA loan. I suggest you contact XXXX Indiana Police Department and listen to your audio tapes regarding over {$100000.00} your company intentionally reported on my credit reporting earlier this year and in which I also filed a cfpb complaint on top of identity theft and freezing my credit with the companies in which they also have taped conversations and I have a copy. Your company then quickly scattered to reverse the intentional negative malicious remarks and adding over {$100000.00} without my knowledge to my current VA mortgage loan. \\n\\nYour representative you're stating is available when I need to talk never returns my calls and does not return emails. I have the calls marked with my phone carrier as well emails that clearly show Mr. XXXX never returns calls nor emails. \\n\\nYour company has Consumer complaint on top of Consumer complaints with the same problem other consumers are having where your company is not reporting payments and incorrectly reporting payments or intentionally reporting negative reports that have as well negatively affected their credit which you have negatively affected mine for almost 18 months and still ongoing. \\n\\nYour representative Mr. XXXX telling me on taped conversations that I might want to look for another bank and refinance was the most ridiculous response and lack of professionalism I've ever come across with any creditor or company. \\n\\nI will continue filing complaints and moving up the ladder until everything is resolved, all payments are marked paid as we agreed upon on the phone tape conversations with your company after being misguided by Mr. XXXX XXXX with XXXX regarding the forbearance plan and telling me prior to stop making payments which was misguided in your company admitted being at fault. Your company agreed after owning up to the misguiding that you would start making all payments correctly reported back in XX/XX/XXXX this year and which they still are not all reported with the credit bureaus. \\n\\nI also need finally positive reports submitted by your company that will positively affect reversing all the damage your company has done by so many negative, misreporting, intensional reporting and malicious reporting for almost 18 months. \\n\\nHow in the world this is not been resolved in such simple request is beyond me and my current bank XXXX XXXX who stated your bank and Company can easily resolve this matter and do not understand why the errors are not being addressed as well as some type of positive report sent to the credit bureaus to help reverse the Damage Done to my credit and credit score. \\n\\nSincerely, XXXX XXXX\",\n",
       " \"On  XXXX   XXXX ,  XXXX , former spouses of  XXXX  -  XXXX  purchased together a  XXXX  condominium.     Both visited  XXXX   XXXX   XXXX /aka  XXXX   XXXX  &  XXXX  local office that were once doing business at a plaza in  XXXX   XXXX , Florida to look at some houses to see if any were affordable. The male purchaser were sick and his former spouse agreed to be his caregiver and co-sign the mortgage.     On  XXXX   XXXX ,  XXXX   XXXX    XXXX    XXXX   XXXX   XXXX   ,   XXXX   XXXX   XXXX   XXXX   XXXX , CT.  XXXX , financed a loan for {$99000.00} using ASC/Wells Fargo. After the couple finish signing agreements and initialing all of them, issuing closing cost certified check as request {$14000.00} which includes the purchase of furnishings inside the unit.     As well as discussing all of the agreements initial and bylaws-maintenance fees, rates, etc. the couple agreed to title insurance fund {$110000.00} that were to cover the value of the property and furnishings ( e.g. schedule A & B ).     The couple understood could cancel the loan within 5 days via fax if there were problems or breach of agreements.     The closing took place at  XXXX  county courthouse and they met Attorney  XXXX   XXXX .  XXXX  and his closing agent  XXXX   XXXX  located at  XXXX   XXXX   XXXX  Issued :  XXXX   XXXX .  XXXX , Agent #  XXXX , Address :  XXXX   XXXX   XXXX   XXXX ,  XXXX   XXXX ,  XXXX   XXXX  Florida,  XXXX .     Around  XXXX  when they return to the unit to change locks and remove a lock placed upon the doorknob and clean the unit. The unit were completely empty and all furnishings were removed by the board of directors who blamed a neighbor next door 7 years later with claims this woman had taken all furnishings and donated everything to the board as a payment for her debts.     In part, the board are responsible for securing the unit and were an accomplice to breach of agreements, theft, harassment and lying about the furnishings and refusal to reimburse or cancel the loan agreements.     There were not any proof of who took the furnishings, however, the amendments and Florida  Condo Act w ere violated, for the private community does specify that if the board are having open house, they are to secure the unit and responsible for the unit under schedule B, most especially if the couple signed a commitment to insure the unit.     Immediately, on  XXXX   XXXX ,  XXXX , the couple called and left a message on the voice mail of  XXXX  county title corp explaining to the closing agent and attorney produced the title insurance fund of $  XXXX  the incident. That they had been robbed and wanted to cancel the loan, if not should able to cancel the loan, at least they should be reimburse the {$10000.00} for the furnishings which were apart of the sale.      XXXX  agent/broker driven over to meet the couple around  XXXX  on  XXXX   XXXX ,  XXXX  and were appalled everything were removed and request that we try and get the board to replace the furnishings or claim the money back from the grantor. We called the grantor and he said yes the furnishings does come with the unit, and he did not sell the unit and come back and steal anything. He explained his wife passed on and he sold the furnishings because he needed money for travel back to his home in Texas. He had not been in Florida but his son the executor of probate for the unit received the check.     On  XXXX   XXXX ,  XXXX  the couple attempt to speak to the board and ask around if anyone seen anything to identify the persons responsible for the theft. Not anyone seem to care and refuses to discuss the removal of furnishings leaving the buyers confused and perplex for 7 years.     On  XXXX   XXXX ,  XXXX  the male spouse passed on from an illness and the title were transfer to the ex  wife ( 2nd  part ) by probate attorney she hired of in  XXXX  county.     We did not want to this point furnishings replaced at this point, but wanted reimbursement of the furnishings in cashiers check for {$10000.00} as we paid {$14000.00} closing cost which includes {$1000.00} deposit and {$10000.00} for furnishings. The husband wanted to cancel and did not want any because he were angry and believe to him it was very disrespectful manner towards the new buyers that this community might be a problem later. The couple could not press charges without knowledge who taken the furnishings.     On  XXXX   XXXX ,  XXXX  the couple called around for legal advice and spoken to attorneys of what to do and were informed in a private community if anything as this occur, it is hard to sue anyone unless really know who stolen the furnishings, but must call Ombudsman and complain to see if the loan could be cancelled. To this point, it was not anything to do press charges and cancel the loan. The board of directors  XXXX   XXXX  and Closing Agents and Attorneys refuses to cancel the loan. Wanting the couple to fax to them at the last minute which takes  XXXX  to 5 days to process that would not meet deadline.     After living there all this time between  XXXX   XXXX  -  XXXX   XXXX , nothing were done, and the loan were not cancel by  XXXX   XXXX   XXXX   XXXX .     On  XXXX   XXXX ,  XXXX , the wife filed taxes and reported the theft to the IRS as being a deadline of 7 years of the negligence of the board of directors who were to secure the unit until closing.

However, the commitment to insure were valid on  XXXX   XXXX ,  XXXX  give account the coupld should have been reimburse or offered new furnishings to stay, or loan cancel whichever they request.     The board president claims at the condo association were that the furnishings were not there when they came by to see if the sale were completed that evening. This information were proof that someone left the door open during closing and the board were responsible and should have cancel the loan.     The couple felt the board should at the least used insurance of the fidelity bond and certificate of title insurance of the association to reimburse $  XXXX  on the unit that the couple signed commitment to insure and were under a fixed conventional mortgage for 30 years.      * Incident 2  --  XXXX   XXXX ,  XXXX  someone kicked out the screen patio door and threaten the woman still living there after husband died some years earlier.    * Incident 3  --  XXXX   XXXX ,  XXXX  the board and accomplices of other nearby units destroy the rear patio of the woman 's unit and tried to hammer her face when she open the door to investigate a burglary.

BetweenXX/XX/XXXX andXX/XX/XXXX Seterus outside tax processing vendor failed to pay the correct tax payment resulting in XXXX tax default noticed placed on the property. In addition, Seterus outside tax processing vendor failed to monitor and update the financial requirements for county taxes resulting in negative escrow balance of $ XXXX. In addition, the escrow analysis that was conduct in XX/XX/XXXX, Seterus outside tax processing vendor stated it had paid the property to County of XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX for the amount of {$2300.00}. However, that payment was never made resulting in the borrower having to pay the property taxes in order to prevent a tax default for the third time. This discrepancy was brought to Seterus attention which resulted in refund to escrow account. This refund caused a significant overage in the escrow account. As a result of the borrower now paying the property tax and insurance, the significant overage in the escrow account that existed inXX/XX/XXXX, the prior tax defaults, and escrow deficiencies due to poor management by Seterus outside tax processing vendor, the borrower requested control of paying the property taxes and insurance going forward. The borrower worked with customer service manager XXXX XXXX who would work with the departments and resources required to close the escrow account. XXXX XXXX instructed the borrower to make the contractual loan payment for principle and interest in the amount of {$1200.00} thus omitting the escrow payment and going forward and pay the property tax. The borrower abided by these temporary terms. Between XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX XXXX XXXX worked diligently to close the escrow account, however the tasks that were entered into Seterus system to close the escrow account were not completed or deleted on several occasions. Because of this, the account fell into a deep default in XX/XX/XXXXdue to the automated payment processing system Seterus utilizes was continuing to fund the escrow account and was shorting the contractual principle and interest payment. This resulted in an escrow account that had substantial overage, but a defaulted account. Since XXXX XXXX had exhausted all her efforts to close the escrow account and corrected the default, XXXX XXXX assumed the effort. In XX/XX/XXXX XXXX XXXX discussed the option of correcting the default by paying the escrow payments that were omitted for the prior months and that Seterus would roll the payments back toXX/XX/XXXX and correct the payment history and bring the account current up toXX/XX/XXXX. The borrower agreed and on XX/XX/XXXX the borrower issued a payment to Seterus for {$2300.00}. Once payment was received, Just XXXX gave specific instruction in a task for account to complete the transaction correction. However, an error occurred and the accounting department to did not complete the task correctly. XXXX XXXX discussed the error with the borrower and because the grace period for XX/XX/XXXX had passed, an additional payment of {$1000.00} was needed to have enough funds available for the accounting department to run the payment correction again. However, the accounting department failed to process the correction correctly. In XX/XX/XXXX, another attempt was made and the borrower issued another payment in the amount of {$1000.00} issued. Once again accounting failed to complete the payment correction. It was determined that the payment system was continuing to acknowledge that an escrow account existed and was continuing to fund that account. As XX/XX/XXXX, the escrow overage had increased to {$6800.00}. Another attempt was made inXX/XX/XXXX to correct the account and required the borrower to provide another {$380.00} which was issued by the borrower onXX/XX/XXXX. Again the effort to correct the account failed. In XX/XX/XXXXthe option of using the escrow surplus to correct the default was discussed. The borrower made the contractual payment of {$1200.00} in order to meet his obligation to the loan. After internal discussion at Seterus, the borrower would need to submit a request to authorize the use of escrow funds to correct the default on the account. That is where this request stems from. The request was to be submitted in XXXX, however an accidental payment for homeowners insurance was issued in the amount of {$890.00}. The borrower needed to wait until the payment was refunded before submitting the request. The refund was credited back to the escrow account on or about XX/XX/XXXX.

However, neither company wanted to work with me and came up with their own amount that they wanted me to pay for the loans, which was quite a lot for me. I was able to make a few payments of what they were wanting me to pay with automatic withdraws from my checking account. There was a few time that I would ask to just have my payment to be taken out a day or two later than the due date due to my paycheck date and they refused to do it. I would have insufficient funds and would be charged fees at my bank account, because they would n't push it back. They kept telling me that if I stayed on the payment plan I would go into good standing and I never was put into good standing even after being on this plan for a few months. My cosigner along with myself would send in payments, because they would send my cosigner papers stating I was late when I was not, so she would in turn send in more money to them. I have always said that the payments that we were posting were not posting correctly and they were just keeping our money. It was hard to verify that due to myself and my cosigner paying different times. When we called to ask they always justified the payments somehow. My student loans have sky high interest rates, even with my cosigner! The interest is still climbing and there is nothing they are willing to do to help me. I have tried to consolidate my loans with another company, but unfortunately my debit to income ratio will not allow me to do so. I have also asked the companies themselves to consolidate my loans and make one payment instead of individual payments, but they said they could not do that either. I have been forced to be but into deferment/forbearance before due to them not working with me during difficult times. I have often thought it would be easier to deal with a collection agency or to have them garnish my wages to have a cheaper payment. I should not have to feel that way with a company that was willing to help me further my education. XXXX XXXX ( Navient ), and the collection agency that my loans called XXXX XXXX XXXX have continuously been calling my employer, cosigner, and myself nonstop!

They have also send over multiple papers that they have requested my employer to fill out which they have and always do and yet they still continue to call me. I have tried to explain to them that my hours are the exact same as their hours are and the easiest way to get a hold of me is through email, but they will not communicate that they. It is very hard and frustration to work with a company that is not will to work with you on payments or even listen to you after you have been telling them not to do something and they continue to do it. My cosigner has tried to talk to them as well and work out something as far as payments go and they are unwilling to work with her either. My cosigner is in a fixed income, which they knew that, and they are requesting most of her income as a payment for the loans. If she was to pay it she would not have enough money to survive and they do n't care.

Nonetheless, my main issue is that Santander may have repossessed my car illegally and may also have violated one or more laws. Upon researching Florida Statues regarding repossession, Santander was and still is in direct violation of Florida Statue 537.012 section 3 which states that At least 10 days prior to sale, the lender shall notify the borrower of the date, time, and place of the sale and provide the borrower with a written accounting of the principal amount due on the title loan, interest accrued through the date the lender takes possession of the titled personal property, and any reasonable expenses incurred to date by the lender in taking possession of, preparing for sale, and selling the titled personal property. I was never notified of any details regarding said sale nor was I notified of a final amount owed.

       " 'After losing my job on XXXX XXXX, 2015, I applied to my lender ( PHH Mortgage ) for a mortgage counselor to assist with my inability to continue with my mortgage payments. I was assigned a mortgage counselor through Mortgage Family Services ( XXXX XXXX ) who I have been working with for the past four months. As instructed I obtained a real estate agent to help guide me through a Short Sale on my home. Working with the counselor I applied for financial assistance and was mailed a financial application to complete. I completed the application and mailed the information back to the counselor. Several weeks went by with no response from the counselor. I called the counselor and she stated that I mailed the application to the wrong address. I explained that I mailed the application to the address on the financial form and she stated that address was incorrect. I then completed another application ( approximately XXXX pages ) and resent to the correct address. Several weeks later I followed up with my counselor on the status of the application and I was advised that she could not find various pages of the application. She explained that she was unable to download pages previously uploaded to the system. This process of not being able to review parts of my application went on for weeks. I had to resend tax forms, financial information, termination of employment letter, bank statements, real estate contracts, etc. I completed at least XXXX applications packages that were resent to the counselor. I was eventually approved for a Short Sale by the lender. In early XXXX 2015 we found a buyer for our home and I advised the counselor of the recent status. I was then assigned a mortgage financial counselor ( XXXX XXXX ) who I spoke with only once. I asked about relocation assistance in which he advised the request must appear on the HUD1 Form. Because he was not aware of the amount we could request in Illinois, he stated he would research and get back to me. Information on the initial financial application stated relocation expense may be approved up to {$10000.00}. XXXX XXXX suggested I submit {$3000.00} for relocation expenses on the HUD-1 Form, which I did. As of the date of this letter, I have not heard back from XXXX XXXX via email or telephone regarding his research on the actual amount of relocation expense I can claim. I last heard from my mortgage counselor ( XXXX XXXX ) more than 2 weeks ago ( XXXX/XXXX/2015 when she advised that she would be out of the office for several days until XXXX/XXXX/2015. I called her on XXXX/XXXX/2015 for a status update, a day after she was to return from her time off but she was not available and has not returned my phone call within the XXXX hour time period. I have not heard from her since XXXX XXXX, 2015. I called and spoke to another agent and she advised to call back in about a week for a status update. I have received forms from the lender ( Affidavits ) that both the seller and buyer have signed, but no one has been able to provide either the buyer or seller the status of the Short Sale. The buyer was eager to close by the end of XXXX 2015 and it is now the middle of XXXX 2015 and it appears the realtors, seller, and buyers do not have a clue on the status of closing on our home. My concern is that the buyers will lose interest in buying the home that they are very interested in purchasing. I have collections calling and writing letters regarding payments I can no longer afford to pay the mortgage. It is ironic that there are buyers for the Short Sale and the process is dragging on with no status updates from the lender.

But when we contacted Sallie Mae to ask why we were receiving the calls and letters, they responded they are automated and will continue to receive them until our 3rd automated payment was processed. We were never told our loans were 60 days late. We asked for a copy of all telephone transcripts of our previous conversations leading up to this point and were told they do not provide them.

Also included in this verification package was a Certificate of Federal Savings Association Title Change and a Field Data sheet. The Field Data sheet also looked like a cheesy XXXX or spreadsheet created, not a screenprint of evidence. Also in this packet was a letter that was supposedly sent to notify that Midland purchased the account, but did not contain any information on how to dispute the account. This letter was also addressed to the address that I DO NOT live at. Also included were several statements from XXXX and from Midland, that were also sent to an address that I did not live at. At the hearing on XX/XX/XXXX, XXXX still insisted that this alleged account was mine. XXXX pushed for me to file an affidavit of fraud and a police report. The court commissioner, which is now the 3rd different one I have seen, literally said, \" I wouldn\\'t do that. \\'\\' Hearing was once again adjourned for XX/XX/XXXX. BUT on XX/XX/XXXX, I received another envelope from XXXX with an affidavit of fraud to file and wanted me to file a police report.

Then this commissioner reamed me for not filing the affidavit of fraud. Next hearing was set for XX/XX/XXXX and I was ordered to do the affidavit of fraud and the police report. I attempted to file a police report but was informed that there was NO evidence that this was my account so the police would not take the report. I did not file the affidavit of fraud because of what the police said. On XX/XX/XXXX, I received another package from XXXX, this one had requests for admission, interrogatories, and requests for production of documents. I did not understand any of it, the wording was SO confusing, none of it made sense and I felt as if no matter how I answered some of them, I would be found guilty. I had no idea what to do and felt lost. I didn\\'t have years of law school to guide me through this nonsense. None of this was plain english, none of it was even complete sentences. 98 % of the document was verbs - past and future tense, adverbs, and adjectives. On XX/XX/XXXX, we had our \" Trial \\'\\' hearing, which was no different than any of the other hearings. Appeared in front of a different court commissioner again. According to the paperwork I had been given by the court at the last hearing, it said that I would be able to present evidence, present arguments, examine witnesses ( no idea how to even get them there ), etc. Well, after XXXX \\'s representative and I entered the little room with the commissioner, the commissioner was ready to base his decision immediately without letting me speak or get a \" fair trial \\'\\'. The whole thing was over in less than 2 minutes. I have it all on tape. He did not see the importance of the date of the affidavits. He literally told me that if I was smart enough to recognize that the language used by XXXX was adverb-verb-adjective mechanics, that I was smart enough to figure out what they were attempting to say in their paperwork. Now I know that my mistake is that I never have been in court before and do not know the proceedings or anything related to law.I did NOT get the luxury of going to law school ( or college for that matter ).

       " 'American Education Services aka PHEAA has been consistently harassing my co-signer and me even after making payments to resolve the delinquencies that occurred on and off throughout the course of the loan payment process. I \\'ve spoken with a number of representatives at AES who claim it \\'s their legal obligation to continue with letters and phone calls until the account is current, in addition to calling and sending letters after the account is current. I also call them whenever I will be late with a payment letting them know when a payment will be made, however they state that calls and letters will still take place. This is a direct violation of my consumer rights as a citizen. This is severe harassment. If I was late with payments, they never fell delinquent past 30 days. In the event that you are calling to make arrangements, that should immediately indemnify any communication unless that payment arrangement becomes null and void as of the scheduled date the payment is set up to be made or thereafter. If communication continues again in the event that a loan is late by only a matter of days, I will be filing a complaint with the district attorney in addition to hiring my own attorney to investigate the constant harassment throughout AES/PHEAA. Keep in mind, that it \\'s absolutely fraudulent to send a co-signer a notice asking for a payment after a payment was already made. That is an attempt to collect money for something that was already collected. Here are a few testimonials I \\'ve found which go into fair details about the immoral activity that takes place at AES/PHEAA : 1. When I first started paying on my student loans I assumed payments were being applied as directed ; I was completely wrong! Please make sure you check on any payment you send to your student loan. I have tried to send an extra payment on a monthly basis to try to pay off my debt, and after countless calls and speaking to managers I have come to accept I have to check on my loan minimum twice a month. The problems have ranged from my extra payments not being applied AT ALL ( in which case I have to send bank statements and copy of check ) to my account being placed on \" Paid Ahead \\'\\' status as it continues to accumulate interest. If you check the website, it states you can target specific loans online, which is completely false. Every manager I speak to gives me a different reason for my payment being applied as they see fit, versus how I am asking for my payment to be applied. Reasons range from putting a cap on how much you can pay towards a subsidized loan to a letter being mailed with the check with \" EXACTWORDING. \\'\\' In one of my previous calls, I had to have the manager dictate the letter I needed to  write, which I send out with my check on a monthly basis. Of course this has done nothing to the way my payment is applied, as now they tell me letters are thrown away once thecheck is received and the person receiving the check is not the one to apply the payment. \\nNow, along with the letter stapled to the check, I have to write 3 things on the memo field of the \\ncheck, \" DO NOT PLACE MY ACCOUNT ON PAID AHEAD STATUS \\'\\', the loan number I want to  target, and my account number. You would assume with all this information I would not have a problem ; however, you are wrong again! My payment is still not applied to the account stated, Ihave to spend a minimum of 15 minutes on the phone verifying all my contact information and getting pass the automated service explaining how I have to call EVERY single month, and I have to wait 7-10 business days before my payment is reapplied. In some cases, this does not happen and I need to call again, in others, I have to submit yet another letter asking them to reapply my  payment. I sure wish I had looked at my loans closely for the first 5 years of payments ; or that I had the money to pay them off once and for all! 2.\\nI have received 6 letters in the mail, and an email claiming and I owe them money for my graduate school loan. All my loans are with XXXX, and they have no record of transferring any of my accounts to another lender. The department of education also has no record of me having any loans with them. What they are doing is fraud and harassment. 3. I borrowed $ XXXX in student loans, which were sold/consolidated with AES. This was the biggest mistake of my life. I would have been better off with a loan shark. I have paid over $ 28K in loan payments but still owe $ XXXX. That means $ XXXX went toward principal and $ XXXX went to interest and fees. I have tried get assistance with to no avail. Their only response is to pay more than my scheduled payment. 4. I received a letter that I was going into default. I called and explained I had recently gone through a separation and was a struggling single parent of XXXX. I could n\\'t afford my regular day to day bills and could n\\'t afford the payment. I was told that I could do a voluntary arrangement on top of the 15 % garnishment that was being sent to my employer. Well I worked 4 plus years in my current position for state of SC and state rules say you ca n\\'t maintain job and have a default loan. So now I \\'m without employment and there is no check to garnish but now my children and I may soon be on the streets. 5. I am very much a responsible borrower. I pay on time and never missed it. This company is not helping students to help pay for student loans. The interest rate keeps increasing after transferring from XXXX XXXX XXXX to AES. It keeps increasing ever since I got transferred to AES. Thiscompany is making people stressed more. I have never received more than 1 bill statement with  Bank XXXX XXXX \\'s account.
