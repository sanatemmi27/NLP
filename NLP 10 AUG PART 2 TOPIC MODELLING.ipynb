I made that application to XXXX of the Dept of Education on XX/XX/XXXX and it was approved as XXXX, by XXXX, on XX/XX/XXXX. From there it went, supposedly to the Utah Higher Education Assistance Authority ( UHEAA ) for further processing. I was notified in XX/XX/XXXX that I would receive a check for {$4000.00} for my effective date of XX/XX/XXXX thru XX/XX/XXXX. The first scam I noted was that the XX/XX/XXXX date was changed to XX/XX/XXXX because I had made my monthly {$170.00} payment on XX/XX/XXXX. When I called UHEAA they found the VA paperwork of XX/XX/XXXX stating that the \" ... VA verifies my effective date of XXXX to be XX/XX/XXXX \\'\\' and told me to call back. The UHEAA employee I had talked to and who had found the official VA letter was n\\'t able to verify that anything could be done to correct any possible mistakes since XXXX \\'s computer data showed the effective date of my XXXX to be XX/XX/XXXX ( Note XX/XX/XXXX and NOT XX/XX/XXXX ). Where XXXX got this date is beyond my comprehension. I called XXXX and talked to one XXXX ( twice I talked to the same XXXX ) and this nasty and mean employee of XXXX refused to offer me any assistance since all the paperwork had been forwarded to UHEAA for processing and there was nothing she could do to clear up XXXX \\'s XXXX on my effective date. She wanted me to quit calling and hung up. I then sent email \\'s to both XXXX and UHEAA with the copies of the pertinent VA letter ( s ). Yesterday I received from UHEAA letters stating that they \\'ve received my XXXX application and it appears to be proper and they were going to forward the paperwork to XXXX for further processing. This entire process I have endured has caused me mental anguish which plays upon my \" panic attacks \\'\\' and these attacks are part and partial of my XXXX. I hate to be considered a whiner but this bureaucratic attack on my intellect and my XXXX is willful and absolutely unnecessary. XXXX and UHEAA appear to be in a collusion to deny any ex-student large portions of the funds that are due the veteran/ex-student for over payment. I have, on hand, records of all my personal checks and/or the dates of the automatic payments made to UHEAA as the collection point for the consolidated loans and the difference between what they sent me in a check ( {$4000.00} ) and what I actually paid is over {$11000.00} for I paid over {$15000.00} from XX/XX/XXXX thru XX/XX/XXXX ( I am missing about 6 months of payment records but can easily acquire them from the bank ). This form of emotional abuse heaped upon me by XXXX and UHEAA is a knowing and intentional conduct directed at me, a vulnerable adult, resulting in my suffering mental anguish, emotional distress, degradation, and confusion. I can see how easy it can be for a bureaucrat of either agency to make a tidy sum through the years cheating a student by \" mistakenly \\'\\' withholding portions of the funds due the student for over payment and that portion is paid to the bureaucrat ( s ) rather than the student. With the amount of money these agencies process and are responsible for, it is nothing to garner thousands of dollars in a short time period.',\n",

       " 'http : XXXX? XXXX & XXXX & XXXX & XXXX & XXXX Imagine if one notice from the federal government could cause you to question your major life decisions. \\n\\nMore than half a million people may have found themselves in that situation after a new legal filing by the Education Department. \\n\\nUnder a program known as Public Service Loan Forgiveness, some student loan borrowers were supposed to be able to have the balance of their student loans forgiven after ten years of both on-time payments and eligible work in the public sector. Meaning, a qualifying nonprofit, federal, local, state, or tribal government. \\n\\nThe program started in 2007, so the first debt was set to be forgiven this coming fall. \\n\\nLast year a small group of borrowers learned that their eligibility for the program had revoked. These include four people, all attorneys, working for the XXXX, the XXXX, and XXXX. \\n\\n\\nStudent Loan Debt Has Nearly Tripled In The Last Decade NPR Ed A New Look At The Lasting Consequences Of Student Debt Nonprofits like these are not 501 ( c ) 3 charities or foundations, so it may be ambiguous whether they fall under the law \\'s definition of \" public service \\'\\'. But the four argued in a lawsuit last XXXX, joined by the bar association itself, that their status should n\\'t have been revoked, certainly not retroactively. \\n\\nThey had followed all the necessary steps to qualify for forgiveness. They \\'d enrolled in the correct repayment program and filled out an Employment Certification Form with XXXX, which acts on behalf of the Education Department. That form certifies that borrowers work for a qualifying organization or a federal, state, tribal or city agency. It \\'s suggested borrowers file an ECF every year. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nOn XXXX, the department responded to the suit, saying, \" XXXX XXXX \\'s response to the ECF does not reflect a final agency action on the borrower \\'s qualifications for PSLF. \\'\\' Meaning, in essence, all those years that borrowers submitted certification forms, the department was n\\'t making any promises about forgiveness. \\n\\nTechnically, the department is only responding to the narrow question about whether this small category of organizations is considered public service or not. However, \" The retroactive aspect of this filing reasonably causes people to be nervous, \\'\\' says XXXX, a senior fellow at the XXXX and a former Deputy Undersecretary of Education under Obama, where he was responsible for overseeing the program during its early years. \\n\\nNervous is right. More than half a million borrowers have signed up for the program. So we put the word out to find out how they were feeling. We heard \" frightened, \\'\\' \" anxious, \\'\\' \" uncertainty, \\'\\' \" regret, \\'\\' \" betrayed. \\'\\' XXXX, who works for a nonprofit providing legal services to the elderly in XXXX, Idaho, has about {$80000.00} in debt. Like many borrowers, she told us, \" A lot of my life-planning decisions were made factoring the loan forgiveness into the equation. \\'\\' She says she turned down higher-paying jobs in the private sector, for example. \" I would feel very betrayed, for both myself and my XXXX sons, if this program is taken away, \\'\\' she says. \" I would likely end up paying on my loans until I was in my XXXX and would have no ability to save for retirement or to help pay for my children \\'s college. \\'\\' XXXX is a parole officer in Texas with about {$30000.00} in loans. \" It \\'s horrible, \\'\\' he writes, \" because I was really depending on that to move on with my life and I do n\\'t know what I \\'m going to do. \\'\\' Not only have many people made financial and career decisions based on the program, some told us they avoided gettin',\n",

This one debt has been sold and resold to XXXX to different debt collecting companies and going past the time limit to pursue debt without a court case. In XX/XX/XXXX XXXX of the credit reporting agencies dropped this debt from my credit files. But XXXX just got around to removing this collection agency ( on! XX/XX/XXXX ). Here is what made me angry, this collection agency company wrote me in same mouth that XXXX said this creditor listing had came to the its legal duration. In this delt collector 's letter in XX/XX/XXXX, they said that the law would not allow them to come after me on an old debt like mind but they would continue to report my debt to the XXXX collection agencies. I then contacted XXXX and they said there was nothing bad on my current credit report files ( debt collector lies ). This debt company is bothering me every other mouth with a {$730.00}. bill I can 40 % off. I 'm retirement age and I surely know retirement income is not subject to law suit. I just want this company to go away and the bills in my male box to stop too. This is a very very old bill that went wrong and should be forgotten.\",\n",
